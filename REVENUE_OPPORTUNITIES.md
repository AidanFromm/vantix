## 1. AI Chatbot Services (Build + Manage)

**What it is:** Building custom AI chatbots for businesses (customer support, lead gen, FAQ, scheduling) and charging monthly to host/maintain them.

**Pricing Range:**
- Setup/build fee: $2,500–$15,000 (one-time)

- Simple chatbot (no-code platform): $99–$500/mo

**Effort to deliver:** Low-medium. Use platforms like Stammer.ai, Voiceflow, or Botpress to build in days, not weeks. Custom-coded bots take longer but command premium pricing.
